What are some changes would you advise the presenter to make their presentation more effective?,Additional comments for the speaker
11/13/2019 15:02:48,5,4,2,1,"As someone who watches basketball, his presentation did not teach me anything new about how the basketball works. I wish he went more in depth in maybe how the data is collected or even how data affected the types of shots people took.  ",I liked the topic he chose. Data is becoming a very big field where it fuels many decisions that businesses make. I liked his use of pictures to explain the concepts of the NBA basketball game.        ,Some changes I would advise the presenter to make that will make their presentation more effective are to focus less on the history part of the NBA and the dynamics of the NBA game. I think he should focus more on the data side and how that data affect business decisions. ,
11/13/2019 15:03:12,5,5,5,5,"Something new I learned from this presentation that I didn't know before that in the NBA before you weren't allowed to dribble the ball and only allowed to pass the ball. Before they had the shot clock of 24 seconds, people used to hold the ball whenever they had the lead into the time would run out so they can win the game the cheesy way.","The thing that worked well for the presenter was that he was very well spoken and very knowledgeable on this subject of the NBA. For somebody who doesn't know anything about basketball , this presentation would fully inform them on how basketball works.",I wouldn't change anything from this presentation because he differently nailed it. All his presentation slides was very informative and explained the rules of basketball. The statistics of score board of what shots players takes during a game.,Great job !
11/13/2019 15:04:19,4,4,4,3,The presentation's topic was about NBA analysts movement. This is a topic that i am interested about.  The presenter talked about the change of styles in history of the NBA with a lot of data analysis.,"The presenter showed in his power point  a lot of datas and images. The images and data were extremely helpful to what the presenter was explaining. The presenter introduced some background about rules of NBA before his presentation, which helps the students that don't know about NBA.",The presenter started with some history of NBA. In this part the presenter didn't showed any images to back his words. He showed that image after he introduced the history. It will be better if he showed it while introducing.,
11/13/2019 15:04:22,3,3,3,5,"Learned about the beginning of the NBA rules how it differed from today. Learned about the passing, dribbling and the three point line. Learned about the most efficient shots and how a player is stated. Learned about NBA terminology.  He expalined the data set and how teams use it.",He went over NBA fundamentals and interacted with the class to explain his presnetation. He was fluid and wasnt scared to explain his presneation. He explain the data for the most efficient shot in the NBA and how NBA teams take advantage of these types of data. He exaplained very well. ,"His presentation was a bit awkward starting, i didnt feel pulled into his presentation and was bored. He couldve spoke a bit louder and with my energy. Some of his slides were hard to read and had too much information on it. ",
11/13/2019 15:05:15,4,5,5,4,"I learned a lot today about NBA Analytics, what the history behind it is. I learnt about the analytics movement of NBA. What the score system was before and what basic box score is and different components of the are. What strategies players use to score more points.",His presentation was unique. He used a lot of visuals and tried to explain lot of examples of how technology has improved player sin improving heir game and how the scoring system has evolved accordingly. He seemed very enthusiastic about the topic as he was not reading off the slides. ,I wish he had first given us an understanding of what he was trying to explain with all the points he was making. He did say he was going to talk about the NBA Analytics movement but it would have been better is he had gone into detail about what the point for that analytics movement was and how it has payed off. ,
11/13/2019 15:07:10,3,3,3,4,"I learned an in depth explanation of the NBA analytics movement, starting from the beginning of the NBA, the rules of basketball and point acquisition based on a player's court position, and a detailed break down of basketball statistics.","The presenter seemed to be very knowledgable in the topic that they were presenting and provided a fair share of diagrams, graphs, and other visual aspects that illustrate the NBA analytics, to support their research. The presentation was very organized and easy to understand.","Since the presentation mostly involved a lot of visual aspects like charts and graphs, with little text, it was a little hard to understand something if I missed hearing something because there were no captions being presented to explain the images other than the presenter themself. If not for the presenter's lecture, I personally would have no way of understanding the pictures shown, but it also shows how knowledgeable the presenter is about their topic, seeing as they could explain and discuss the topic with the support of images alone.",
11/13/2019 15:07:30,5,5,4,5,"I learned about the box score, and different ways people in the NBA use NBA analytics to evaluate a players performance.  It was also nice seeing the history of the 3 point line which was something I never knew before. The video at the end demonstrating the tool was also something I didn't know about before.","I think the presenter was very well informed about his topic. He gave good details, diagrams, and descriptions on his slides. The topic was also very common, which was good because it made it interesting. The presenter also walked around and used hand motions to help his presentation.",I think the presenter could use a little more enthusiasm in his voice. It was very dry and bland so it made it harder to follow along. Varying the volume and tone of his voice would help a lot. It's a great way to grab the attention of the audience.,"Nice topic, good job!"
11/13/2019 15:07:42,5,5,5,5,"I learned the differences in NBA between now and many years ago. The way that the ball is dribbled is different now, the shooting point back then used to be 2 points maximum, now it’s 3 points, which are the most efficient in the game. A person’s box score is used to see how good the person played during a basketball. There is a lot of new technology today that can choose to focus on a player and watch the moves that he makes during the game and analyze the probability of the player making a shot in real-time.","He knew his topic very well and was able to explain everything without using his notes. He also had a lot of pictures, graphs, analytics on his slides which he was able to use to explain to us the different features of basketball and the changes from now and years ago. He showed a timeline of the history of NBA data and the differences between the dark ages, the box era and the data ball. He also showed us the technology that is used today to analyze each player’s abilities. ","Although he showed that he was an expert on his topic by not having notes, I think that it would have been helpful to have some information on the slides for the visual learners, because not everyone can focus and understand just what is going on as audio. ",
11/13/2019 15:07:48,5,5,5,5,I learned that the NBA has changes the rules and it has a big effect on the scores of the games. I also learned that they take a lot of data from the games and see how they can make the games more entertaining.,The presenter did a good job showing the data the NBA collects and explaining it in a very friendly way to people who don't know much about it at all. He also did a good job showing the tech they use.,There isn't much that they can improve he did a good job getting his point across in a friendly manner for those who don't know anything about NBA at all. The presentation overall was very well executed.,Very interesting presentation
11/13/2019 15:08:06,5,5,5,5,"The detail of Virtual Reality, History of Virtual Reality. Usage of Virtual Reality (Entertainment).

11/13/2019 15:09:28,5,5,5,5,I learned a lot about data analytics in terms of scoring efficiency in the NBA and how the revolution of the 3 point shot has changed the way basketball has been played and will continue to effect how teams shoot in the future.,The presenter was very well informed on his topic and showed numerous examples on how technology effects the way basketball in played now and also spoke very eloquently and broke down the plays very well.,I didn't really think there was any points to improve upon because the presentation was very information and very substantial in terms of its data and application to the topic. If anything he could've applied analytics to more sports.,"Greatest presentation in the class so far, no cap. Thoroughly enjoyed it."

NBA Analytics Movement. The two important to the NBA history. The differences between before the day and now a day. The role of NBA which I didn’t know about. Lot of information of analytics as the NBA team. Some photo and video to show how NBA player to play.

11/13/2019 15:11:14,5,4,5,5,"Matthew did a presentation on NBA analytics and I thought it was very interesting because he chose a topic that I do not know anything about, Basketball, this presentation taught me a bit about the rules and how when I watch a game with a group of people I can now pretend I know a bit about it. I never knew how technology could be incorporated into sports, but now I know a bit about second spectrum.","The presenter chose a very different type of topic where he explained the real life application of technologies such as the Second Spectrum, which is the official video tracking technology provider for the NBA and the technique that Second Spectrum uses identifies and augments data extracted from the video to generate insights and visualize new types of stats such as Quantified Shot Quality (qSQ) and Quantified Shooter Impact (qSI) so the context produced can be used for storytelling.","I believe that the presenter did an amazing job and I learned a lot from the presentation. The only thing that would had made this presentation even better would be if the presenter had spoken a bit clearer, but overall an interesting presentation. ",
11/13/2019 15:14:22,3,3,3,3,"In the NBA, the 3- point score is very low in 1979. The middle side of the ring under the basket is easier to get 3 points. There is some technology that collected data from the game. Thus, it could calculate where is the best place to shoot 3 points.",He show us the history  of NBA. And he demonstrated the video that how the software calculate the chance of each player would shoot. He explained clear and it is easy to understand.                            ,The power point can add more information about the history of NBA. He can add more comment of what he know. And he can introduced more rule of NBA because some people didn't watch basketball game before. ,
11/14/2019 18:52:25,3,3,5,5,Topic was NBA Analytics. He talked about the important things about NBA history. Presenter mentioned the 3 point and 2 point rule. Back then there is no 3 point line. I learnt when you shoot from behind the 3 point line it worth more than 2 point line.,The part where he talked about box score was interesting. Because they evaluate players by looking their box score. It shows how well player play during the game. He also talked how they got evaluated by using the technology right now. It is easy to see how efficient is the player in that play with technology.,He used graphs and statistic and pictures to explain his point but personally I had no idea and interest to NBA. With technology they can seethe players on the game how good or bad they were. I wish he has more explanation about technology since ppl in the class has interest to technology.,
11/14/2019 19:21:09,5,4,5,4,I learned that the National Basketball Association use a box scoring system to determine how well a player performs. I have also learned that the Houston Rockets team was known for their best offensive tactics because of their heavy focus on three pointers and dunks.,"Mathew managed to display a picture of a basketball field for the audience who have no knowledge on it, as he pointed out where the three point lines are. He also showed a technology that many NBA teams use to determine the probabilities of scoring points based on each player's position.","Mathew should explain what some of the important categories in the box scoring system means. I know there are too many to go over, but the important ones should be enough for the audience to understand what each term means.",
11/18/2019 15:15:56,4,4,4,3,"I understand that the current development of technology is not only the convenience of the Internet.The development of science and technology at the same time led to the development of many different forms of industry.Technology can effectively improve the systematic analysis and improvement of NBA players.The different use of the data gives a detailed analysis of the data, which has a significant help for the players to improve themselves.","The presenter used the NBA as an example of Internet technology to effectively show how technology can help these industries.This is good for students to expand the use of technology thinking.At the same time, the detailed development history and data analysis will help students understand how the data analysis brought by technology works in these industries.","Presenters need less analysis of NBA history.These are just to highlight the results of the use of technology.Therefore, the history of the non-technological era needs only a brief introduction, not a lot of detailed information.At the same time, presenters can look for examples of other technologies being used in the NBA, rather than focusing on the use of data analysis.",
11/18/2019 20:00:18,4,4,4,4,"I learn some of NBA analytics movement for the point of basic box score for the basketball, and some of rise of pointers throughout NBA history of the score of each basketball player to got point in each game.","Presenter show a lot of details for the NBA history and the score for each basketball player to get the point, and show some of James harden shot chart and Michael Jordan shot chart of the basketball.","Presenter should be provide a little more detail about the NBA player to got the score in each game, and should be give more background image and video to show the NBA player to got score in each game.",
11/22/2019 15:40:16,5,5,5,5,"I learned a lot from Mathew's presentation. I learned about history, improvements and how data was gathering throughout NBA history. It was really nice to see how nowadays technologies are showing percentages of chances of players to make a proper shot.","I would say that was the best presentation I ever seen. Because Mathew had introduction, main part and conclusion in his presentation. And each part of it was very well supported by slides with explanations and videos.",I would suggest to Mathew to keep doing that because it was really nice and worthy presentation. I might suggest to talk a little bit louder to show your enthusiastic. But overall it was very very nice!,
11/22/2019 21:45:59,5,5,5,5,The presenter tried to describe us the NBA analytics movement. For me it was a completely unknown ground so most of the stuff described was completely new to me. I was surprised to find out how the technology influenced over the years the sport industry and specifically the NBA.,The presenter seemed genuinely passionate about the topic and described his point very well while drawing a good picture of how the sport industry is affected by AI and what we can expect in the near future.,"Most of the presentation was very interesting to watch however I would advice the presenter to use less tables and more charts while trying to showcase statistics. Other than that, I can't think of any other suggestions to make this presentation more effective.
",Interesting topic and good presentation. Thank you!
11/24/2019 16:05:45,5,5,5,5,"History of NBA, shot clock used to be non existent and allow teams to hold the ball and wait out the rest of the game. Shot clock increased the amount of points able to be scored per game. Box score explained!","Good use of showing the court to explain points and how they are accrued. interesting topic, lots of information i didn't previously know about basketball and rules. good explanation of major statistics people use to determine how well a specific player plays during a game.",Great presentation! lots of information with useful slides. cant think of many ways to improve presentation besides showing clips of games of low scoring games and how they changed the court and rules to incentivize baskets through the years but not necessary. ,Interesting and well done presentation!
